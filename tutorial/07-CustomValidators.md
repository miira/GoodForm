Custom Validators
===

Now let's define some custom validation logic for our JobApplication form.

An easy way to add a custom validator is to extend the `FormValidationService` class,

To do, create a new Service for the goodform_tutorial project, by running

    grails create-service JobApplicationValidatorService

Once this has been done, define your validation logic as a method within the service.  The method should take two arguments, the first
being a FormElement instance, and the second being a String, which represents the entered value.  The method should
also return a boolean, which indicates whether the field passes validation or not.

For our example, let's create a method which validates that the attachment is a pdf file.

Add the following method to the FileValidationService class

```groovy
    def pdf_only(FormElement formElement, String filename) {
        return filename.endsWith(".pdf")
    }
```

The message to be displayed when the validation fails can be defined in the `grails-app\i18n\messages.properties` file
for the goodform_tutorial project.  In this case, we'll add the following property:

```
goodform.validate.pdf_only.invalid=Only PDF files are supported
```

We then need to register the custom validator.  To do this, add the following code into your BootStrap.groovy file.

```groovy
class BootStrap {
    def formValidationService

    def init = { servletContext ->
        ...
        def ctx = servletContext.getAttribute(ApplicationAttributes.APPLICATION_CONTEXT)
        formValidationService.addCustomValidator("pdf_only", {formElement, fieldValue -> ctx.jobApplicationValidatorService.pdf_only(formElement, fieldValue)})
        ...
    }
}
```

We can now define our forms which reference the `pdf_only` validator, eg.

```groovy
form {
    question("Job5") {
        "Resume" group: "resume", {
            "Attach a copy of your resume" attachment: "resume_file", map: 'resume', validator: 'pdf_only'
         }
   }
}
```
