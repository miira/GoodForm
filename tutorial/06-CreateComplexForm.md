Complex Forms
===

Let's now create a new form that will span several pages.  Add the following to your BootStrap.groovy file:

```groovy
    String jobApplicationDefinition = """
form {
   question("Job1") {
       "What is your name?" group: "names", {
           "Title" text: 10, hint: "e.g. Mr, Mrs, Ms, Miss, Dr", suggest: "title"
           "Given Names" text: 50, required: true
           "Last or Family Name" text: 50, required: true
           "Have you been or are you known by any other names?" hint: "e.g. maiden name, previous married name, alias, name at birth", {
               "List your other names" listOf: "aliases", {
                   "Other name" text: 50
                   "Type of name" text: 40, hint: "e.g maiden name", suggest: "nameType"
               }
           }
       }
   }
   question("Job2") {
       "Contact details" group: "contact", {
           "Home address" text: 200
           "Postcode" number: 4, hint: "e.g. 2913"
           "Home Phone" phone: 15
           "Mobile Phone" phone: 15
           "Work Phone" phone: 15
       }
   }
   question("Job3") {
      "Education" group: "education", {
          "University" listOf: "universities", {
              "Name" text: 20
              "Years attended" text: 20
              "Degree" text: 20
              "Course" text: 20
          }
          "High School" listOf: "highSchools", {
             "Name" text: 20
             "Years attended" text: 20
          }
      }
   }

   //role applying for
   question("Job4") {
        "Enter the details of the role you are applying for" group: "role", {
              "Position" text: 50, required: true
              "Company" text: 50, required: true
        }
   }
   //include copy of resume
   question("Job5") {
        "Resume" group: "resume", {
            "Attach a copy of your resume" attachment: "resume_file"
         }
   }
   //referee details
   question("Job6") {
        "Enter details for two referees" group: "references", {
              "Referee" listOf: "referee", {
                  "Given Names" text: 50, required: true
                  "Last or Family Name" text: 50, required: true
                  "Contact Phone" phone: 15, required: true
              }

        }
   }
}"""

    if(!FormDefinition.findByName('JobApplication')) {
        formDataService.createNewFormVersion('JobApplication', jobApplicationDefinition)
    }

```

This creates a JobApplication form definition, which contains six questions.

This form adds some extra form elements, notably:

* phone - validates that the entered value conforms to phone number validation rules
* attachment - allows a file to be selected and uploaded as part of the form submission

To configure the questions to span multiple pages, create the following ruleset files in the ~/.OneRing/rules/application directory:

#JobApplication_firstQuestion.ruleset

```groovy
ruleset("JobApplication") {

    abortOnFail = false

    rule("First page of questions") {
        when {
            true
        }
        then {
            next = ['Job1', 'Job2', 'Job3']
        }
    }

}
```

#JobApplicationJob3.ruleset

```groovy
ruleset("JobApplicationJob3") {

    require(['Job1', 'Job2', 'Job3'])  //we need the answers to these questions

    abortOnFail = true

	rule("Second page of job application questions") {
        when {
            true
        }
        then {
            next = ['Job4', 'Job5', 'Job6']
        }
    }

}
```

#JobApplicationJob6.ruleset

```groovy
ruleset("JobApplicationJob6") {

    require(['Job4', 'Job5', 'Job6'])  //we need the answers to these questions

    abortOnFail = true

	rule('finished') {
        when {
            true
        }
        then {
            next = ['End']
        }
    }
}
```

Let's go back to our goodform_tutorial Grails application, and create a new controller for this form.  We do this by running

    grails create-controller JobApplicationForm

from the ~/goodform_tutorial directory.

Update the controller to extend from the com.nerderg.goodForm.FormController class

```groovy
import com.nerderg.goodForm.FormController

class JobApplicationFormController extends FormController {
    def createForm() {
        createForm('JobApplication')
    }
}
```

Once this has been done, run

    grails compile

and go to http://localhost:8080/goodform_tutorial/jobApplication/createForm

This will display the first three questions of the form.

![Job Application Page 1](img/job_application_page_1.png)

Upon entering the mandatory fields and clicking submit, the second page of form questions will be displayed.

![Job Application Page 2](img/job_application_page_2.png)

The answers entered on the first page will be listed below the questions.
